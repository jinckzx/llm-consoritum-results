      "response": "<thought_process>\nTo determine the order of the differential equation given, we need to understand what is meant by the 'order' of a differential equation. \n\n1. **Identifying the structure**: The given equation is dy/dx + y = 3y^2. The term 'dy/dx' designates the first derivative of y with respect to x, while 'y' and '3y^2' are algebraic expressions of the function y itself.\n\n2. **Definition of order**: The order of a differential equation is defined as the highest derivative present in the equation. It does not involve any algebraic expressions of the variables; it strictly pertains to the derivatives.\n\n3. **Analyzing the equation**: In the given equation, the only derivative present is dy/dx, which is the first derivative of y with respect to x. Thus, we see that the highest derivative present is the first derivative.\n\n4. **Conclusion based on definition**: Since the highest derivative in the equation is the first derivative, the differential equation is of order 1. \n\nNo other complications or higher derivatives are present in the equation, which reinforces the conclusion that the order is simply determined by the first derivative found in the expression.\n\n</thought_process>\n\n<answer>\nThe order of the differential equation dy/dx + y = 3y^2 is 1.\n</answer>\n\n<confidence>\n1\n</confidence>",
