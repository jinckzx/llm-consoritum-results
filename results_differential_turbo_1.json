The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest derivative that appears in the equation.\n\n1. **Identify Derivatives**: In this equation, the term \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} \\) is the first derivative of \\( y \\) with respect to \\( x \\). There are no higher-order derivatives present in the equation.\n  \n2. **Determine Order**: Since the highest derivative present is the first derivative, the order of this differential equation is 1.\n\n3. **Consider Possible Doubts**: There are no complexities regarding the form of the equation that would suggest a higher order, as the presence of the term \\( 3y^2 \\) is non-linear but does not affect the order of the equation.\n\n4. **Clarification of Terms**: It\u2019s important to note that while the equation is non-linear due to the \\( y^2 \\) term, non-linearity does not impact the order, which strictly relates to the derivatives\u2019 ranks.\n\nGiven the analysis above, I confidently conclude that the order of the differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} + y = 3y^2 \\) is 1.\n\n</thought_process>\n\n<answer>\nThe order of the differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} + y = 3y^2 \\) is 1.\n</answer>\n\n<confidence>\n1\n</confidence>",
